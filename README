DNA-Life
Artificial life in python

Make organisms out of 'DNA' which is an assembly-like programming language.
Organisms compete for food in an 'arena', a finite two-dimensional grid world.
Organisms will 'reproduce' and pass along their DNA to their offspring, with
a small chance of mutation.

In this way, hopefully efficent organisms will evolve over time.  It should be
interesting to see which programs survive and which fail.
